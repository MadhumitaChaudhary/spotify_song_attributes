# Spotify Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset from Spotify to gain insights into user listening habits and preferences.

## Dataset

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/byomokeshsenapati/spotify-song-attributes

The dataset contains the following fields:

- `endTime`: The time the song finished playing.
- `artistName`: The name of the artist.
- `trackName`: The name of the track.
- `msPlayed`: The duration the track was played, in milliseconds.
- `danceability`: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
- `energy`: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
- `key`: The key the track is in.
- `loudness`: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
- `mode`: Modality of the track (Major or Minor).
- `speechiness`: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
- `acousticness`: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
- `instrumentalness`: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.
- `liveness`: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
- `valence`: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
- `tempo`: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).
- `duration_ms`: The duration of the track in milliseconds.
- `time_signature`: An estimated overall time signature of a track.

## Analysis

The analysis involves:

1. Loading and exploring the data.
2. Cleaning the data (handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers).
3. Conducting exploratory data analysis (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis).
4. Feature engineering and scaling.
5. Clustering the data to identify patterns and insights.

## Results

The results of the analysis will be used to gain insights into user listening habits and preferences, which can be used for targeted advertising and recommendations.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Note

This is a work in progress. The analysis is ongoing, and the README will be updated as more progress is made.
